<h1>CSC 300/Data Structures in Java I<br />Assignment: Counting letters in a text file</h1>
<h2>20 points</h2>
<hr />
<h2>Setting up</h2>
<p>
First, please read the section "Assignments and grading" in the <a href="Syllabus.html">syllabus</a>.  Then, following the steps for <a href="Creating programs.html">creating programs</a>, create a package called <code>countLetters</code>.
</p>
<h2>Specifications</h2>
<p>
Write a program called <code>CountLetters.java</code> that prompts the user for the name of a text file, reads in all of the text in that file, and then computes and prints a table of letter frequencies.  For example, if the file is the text of the U.S. constitution, which you downloaded for the <code>CountLetters</code> program, the program will print:
<pre>
Enter the name of the file: data/constitution.txt
a	 2,660
b	   611
c	 1,190
d	 1,223
e	 5,108
f	 1,018
g	   439
h	 2,019
i	 2,486
j	    95
k	    53
l	 1,478
m	   725
n	 2,635
o	 2,739
p	   764
q	    46
r	 2,187
s	 2,693
t	 3,755
u	   843
v	   473
w	   372
x	   124
y	   503
z	    31
</pre>
</p>
<h2>Submission instructions</h2>
<p>
When done correctly, you will have a single program <code>CountLetters.java</code> in a package called <code>countLetters</code>.  This is located in your file system under the workspace folder you created for Eclipse.  Starting at that folder, navigate to <code>algs4/src/countLetters</code>.  Zip that folder (that is, zip the folder <code>countLetters</code> NOT just the file <code>CountLetters.java</code>) into a zip file called <code>countLetters.zip</code> and submit that zip file into the D2L dropbox for this assignment no later than its due date.
</p>
<p>
Four very important points to remember:
<ol>
<li>
Your name must appear in a comment at the top of the program.  You can insert it either in this style:
<pre>
// Author: Alan Turing
</pre>
or this style:
<pre>
/*
 * Author: Alan Turing
 */
</pre>
<li>
Give the files the names EXACTLY as specified, including the capitalization.  Not doing so will cause points to be deducted.
</li>
<li>
A submission may be graded as soon as it appears in its drop box.  In other words, don't submit until you're sure that you want the program graded.
</li>
<li>
Just after the due date, zero points will automatically be given any assignment not submitted.
</li>
</ol>
