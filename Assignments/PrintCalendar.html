<h1>CSC 300/Data Structures in Java I<br />Assignment: Print a calendar</h1>
<h2>15 points</h2>
<hr />
<h2>Setting up</h2>
<p>
First, please read the section "Assignments and grading" in the <a href="Syllabus.html">syllabus</a>.  Then, following the steps for <a href="Creating programs.html">creating programs</a>, create a package called <code>printCalendar</code>.
</p>
<h2>Specifications</h2>
<p>
In class we discussed the <code>Date</code> class.  There is a Date class available in the <code>algs12</code> package.  Using it (which you can access with the statement <code>import algs12.Date</code>) write a program called <code>PrintCalendar</code> that prompts the user for a start date and an end date and then prints all of the dates between them (inclusive), with seven tab-separated dates on each line.  Here is an example of a run of the program:
<pre>
Enter a starting date: 1/1/2015
Enter an ending date: 3/1/2015

1/1/2015&#09;1/2/2015&#09;1/3/2015&#09;1/4/2015&#09;1/5/2015&#09;1/6/2015&#09;1/7/2015
1/8/2015&#09;1/9/2015&#09;1/10/2015&#09;1/11/2015&#09;1/12/2015&#09;1/13/2015&#09;1/14/2015
1/15/2015&#09;1/16/2015&#09;1/17/2015&#09;1/18/2015&#09;1/19/2015&#09;1/20/2015&#09;1/21/2015
1/22/2015&#09;1/23/2015&#09;1/24/2015&#09;1/25/2015&#09;1/26/2015&#09;1/27/2015&#09;1/28/2015
1/29/2015&#09;1/30/2015&#09;1/31/2015&#09;2/1/2015&#09;2/2/2015&#09;2/3/2015&#09;2/4/2015
2/5/2015&#09;2/6/2015&#09;2/7/2015&#09;2/8/2015&#09;2/9/2015&#09;2/10/2015&#09;2/11/2015
2/12/2015&#09;2/13/2015&#09;2/14/2015&#09;2/15/2015&#09;2/16/2015&#09;2/17/2015&#09;2/18/2015
2/19/2015&#09;2/20/2015&#09;2/21/2015&#09;2/22/2015&#09;2/23/2015&#09;2/24/2015&#09;2/25/2015
2/26/2015&#09;2/27/2015&#09;2/28/2015&#09;3/1/2015
</pre>
</p>
<p>
To help with this, here is (part of) the API for the algs12.Date class:
<ul>
<li><code>public Date(int month, int day, int year)</code>: This constructs a Date object from the values given.
<li><code>public Date(String dateString)</code>: This constructs a Date object from a String formatted as an American date, e.g., "5/6/2017" would create a Date object for May 6th, 2017.
<li><code>public Date next()</code>: When called with a Date object, this returns a new Date object representing the next day.
<li><code>public boolean equals(Date that)</code>: Returns true if the Date object for which it is called is equal to the <code>that</code> Date object.
<li><code>public boolean isBefore(Date that)</code>: Returns true if the Date oject for which it is called is strictly before the </code>that</code> Date object.
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Before printing the calendar, your program should check that the first date is not after the second date.  If it is, it should print an error message and not print the calendar.
</p>
<h2>Submission instructions</h2>
<p>
When done correctly, you will have a single program <code>PrintCalendar.java</code> in a package called <code>printCalendar</code>.  This is located in your file system under the workspace folder you created for Eclipse.  Starting at that folder, navigate to <code>algs4/src/printCalendar</code>.  Zip that folder (that is, zip the folder <code>printCalendar</code> NOT just the file <code>PrintCalendar.java</code>) into a zip file called <code>printCalendar.zip</code> and submit that zip file into the D2L dropbox for this assignment no later than its due date.
</p>
<p>
Four very important points to remember:
<ol>
<li>
Your name must appear in a comment at the top of the program.  You can insert it either in this style:
<pre>
// Author: Alan Turing
</pre>
or this style:
<pre>
/*
 * Author: Alan Turing
 */
</pre>
<li>
Give the files the names EXACTLY as specified, including the capitalization.  Not doing so will cause points to be deducted.
</li>
<li>
A submission may be graded as soon as it appears in its drop box.  In other words, don't submit until you're sure that you want the program graded.
</li>
<li>
Just after the due date, zero points will automatically be given any assignment not submitted.
</li>
</ol>
