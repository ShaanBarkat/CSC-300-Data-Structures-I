<h1>CSC 300/Data Structures in Java I<br />Assignment: Search text in file</h1>
<h2>15 points</h2>
<hr />
<h2>Setting up</h2>
<p>
First, please read the section "Assignments and grading" in the <a href="Syllabus.html">syllabus</a>.  Then, following the steps for <a href="Creating programs.html">creating programs</a>, create a package called <code>searchText</code>.
</p>
<h2>Specifications</h2>
<p>
<p>
Write a program called <code>SearchText.java</code> that:
<ol>
<li>Prompts the user for a text file pathname.</li>
<li>Prompts the user for a search string.</li>
<li>Reads in all of the text in the file.</li>
<li>Splits that text into an array of words.</li>
<li>Prints a list of every word that contains the search string.</li>
<li>After that list, prints a count of how many words contain that search string.</li>
</ol>
For example, running this program for the file <a href="constitution.txt"><code>constitution.txt</code></a> and using the search string <code>qu</code> produces the output:
<pre>
Tranquility
requisite
subsequent
Consequence

Number of words containing "qu": 42
</pre>
As models, consult the programs from week 1 that count words.  You will have to look up the method in the String class that indicates whether one string contains another.
</p>
<h2>Submission instructions</h2>
<p>
When done correctly, you will have a single program <code>SearchText.java</code> in a package called <code>searchText</code>.  This is located in your file system under the workspace folder you created for Eclipse.  Starting at that folder, navigate to <code>algs4/src/searchText</code>.  Zip that folder (that is, zip the folder <code>searchText</code> NOT just the file <code>SearchText.java</code>) into a zip file called <code>searchText.zip</code> and submit that zip file into the D2L dropbox for this assignment no later than its due date.
</p>
<p>
Four very important points to remember:
<ol>
<li>
Your name must appear in a comment at the top of the program.  You can insert it either in this style:
<pre>
// Author: Alan Turing
</pre>
or this style:
<pre>
/*
 * Author: Alan Turing
 */
</pre>
<li>
Give the files the names EXACTLY as specified, including the capitalization.  Not doing so will cause points to be deducted.
</li>
<li>
A submission may be graded as soon as it appears in its drop box.  In other words, don't submit until you're sure that you want the program graded.
</li>
<li>
Just after the due date, zero points will automatically be given any assignment not submitted.
</li>
</ol>
