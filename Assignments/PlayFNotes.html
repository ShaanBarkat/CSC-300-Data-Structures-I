<h1>CSC 300/Data Structures in Java I<br />Assignment: Play three F notes</h1>
<h2>10 points</h2>
<hr />
<h2>Setting up</h2>
<p>
First, please read the section "Assignments and grading" in the <a href="Syllabus.html">syllabus</a>.  Then, following the steps for <a href="Creating programs.html">creating programs</a>, create a package called <code>playFNotes</code>.
</p>
<h2>Specifications</h2>
<p>
<p>
Using the program classes <code>NBCTones</code> and <code>SITTones</code> in the week 1 examples package, write a program class called <code>PlayFNotes</code> that plays in order the notes F<sub>4</sub>, F<sub>5</sub>, and F<sub>6</sub>, each for one and a half seconds.  The frequency of F<sub>4</sub> is 349.228Hz.  Look up the other two.  You will need the <code>playTone</code> method so simply copy it from one of the example programs into your program.  Note that the second parameter, <code>duration</code>, should be the number of seconds to play the tone.
</p>
<h2>Submission instructions</h2>
<p>
When done correctly, you will have a single program <code>PlayFNotes.java</code> in a package called <code>playFNotes</code>.  This is located in your file system under the workspace folder you created for Eclipse.  Starting at that folder, navigate to <code>algs4/src/playFNotes</code>.  Zip that folder (that is, zip the folder <code>playFNotes</code> NOT just the file <code>PlayFNotes.java</code>) into a zip file called <code>playFNotes.zip</code> and submit that zip file into the D2L dropbox for this assignment no later than its due date.
</p>
<p>
Four very important points to remember:
<ol>
<li>
Your name must appear in a comment at the top of the program.  You can insert it either in this style:
<pre>
// Author: Alan Turing
</pre>
or this style:
<pre>
/*
 * Author: Alan Turing
 */
</pre>
<li>
Give the files the names EXACTLY as specified, including the capitalization.  Not doing so will cause points to be deducted.
</li>
<li>
A submission may be graded as soon as it appears in its drop box.  In other words, don't submit until you're sure that you want the program graded.
</li>
<li>
Just after the due date, zero points will automatically be given any assignment not submitted.
</li>
</ol>
