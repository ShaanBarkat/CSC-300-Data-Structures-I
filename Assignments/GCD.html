<h1>CSC 300/Data Structures in Java I<br />Assignment: Compute the GCD of two integers</h1>
<h2>10 points</h2>
<hr />
<h2>Setting up</h2>
<p>
First, please read the section "Assignments and grading" in the <a href="Syllabus.html">syllabus</a>.  Then, following the steps for <a href="Creating programs.html">creating programs</a>, create a package called <code>gcd</code>.
</p>
<h2>Specifications</h2>
<p>
Using the <code>LotteryOdds</code> class in the <a href="week1examples.zip">week 1 examples package</a> as an example, write a class called <code>GCD</code> that prompts the user for two integers and then computes and prints their greatest common divisor (GCD).
<p>
Here is a Python version of a program to do that:
<pre>
def gcd(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return a
    return gcd(b, a%b)

a = int(input("Enter a: "))
b = int(input("Enter b: "))
print("The gcd is", gcd(a,b))
</pre>
Note that the main part of the Python program is the last three lines and that, in Java, the main code goes into the <code>main</code> method, as in <code>LotteryOdds</code>.
</p>
<h2>Submission instructions</h2>
<p>
When done correctly, you will have a single program <code>GCD.java</code> in a package called <code>gcd</code>.  This is located in your file system under the workspace folder you created for Eclipse.  Starting at that folder, navigate to <code>algs4/src/gcd</code>.  Zip that folder (that is, zip the folder <code>gcd</code> NOT just the file <code>GCD.java</code>) into a zip file called <code>gcd.zip</code> and submit that zip file into the D2L dropbox for this assignment no later than its due date.
</p>
<p>
Four very important points to remember:
<ol>
<li>
Your name must appear in a comment at the top of the program.  You can insert it either in this style:
<pre>
// Author: Alan Turing
</pre>
or this style:
<pre>
/*
 * Author: Alan Turing
 */
</pre>
<li>
Give the files the names EXACTLY as specified, including the capitalization.  Not doing so will cause points to be deducted.
</li>
<li>
A submission may be graded as soon as it appears in its drop box.  In other words, don't submit until you're sure that you want the program graded.
</li>
<li>
Just after the due date, zero points will automatically be given any assignment not submitted.
</li>
</ol>
