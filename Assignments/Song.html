<h1>CSC 300/Data Structures in Java I<br />The Song class</h1>
<h2>15 points</h2>
<hr />
<h2>Setting up</h2>
<p>
First, please read the section "Assignments and grading" in the <a href="Syllabus.html">syllabus</a>.  Then, following the steps for <a href="Creating programs.html">creating programs</a>, create a package called <code>song</code>.
</p>
<h2>Specifications</h2>
<p>
Write a reference class called <code>Song</code>.  It represents a simple song consisting of two sequences, one of durations and one of frequencies.  Here is its API:
<ul>
<li><code>public Song()</code>: this constructor creates a Song object with empty duration and frequency sequences.
<li><code>public void addFrequency(double frequency)</code>: this method adds a frequency to the sequence of frequencies.
<li><code>public void addDuration(double duration)</code>: this method adds a duration to the sequence of durations.
<li><code>public void play()</code>: this plays the sequence of durations and frequencies.  It does this by indexing through both sequences, calling the <code>playTone</code> method on each individual duration and frequency.
</ul>
In addition to those public methods above, place in your class a private version of the <code>playTone</code> method from an earlier assignment.  Its first line will be:
<pre>
	private void playTone(double frequency, double duration) {
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Test your class by placing my <code><a href="PlaySong.java">PlaySong.java</a></code> program into your <code>song</code> package.  My program creates a <code>Song</code> object, reads a series of durations and frequencies from a file into it, and then calls the <code>play()</code> method.  You will also need to copy my <code><a href="march.txt">march.txt</a></code> file into your Eclipse <code>data</code> folder.
</p>
<h2>Submission instructions</h2>
<p>
When done correctly, you will end up with two Java files: Your  <code>Song.java</code> reference class and my <code>PlaySong.java</code> program.  Place them both in a package called <code>song</code>.  As always, zip the <code>song</code> folder in your Eclipse into the file <code>song.zip</code> and submit that zip file into the D2L dropbox for this assignment no later than its due date.
</p>
<p>
Four very important points to remember:
<ol>
<li>
Your name must appear in a comment at the top of the program.  You can insert it either in this style:
<pre>
// Author: Alan Turing
</pre>
or this style:
<pre>
/*
 * Author: Alan Turing
 */
</pre>
<li>
Give the files the names EXACTLY as specified, including the capitalization.  Not doing so will cause points to be deducted.
</li>
<li>
A submission may be graded as soon as it appears in its drop box.  In other words, don't submit until you're sure that you want the program graded.
</li>
<li>
Just after the due date, zero points will automatically be given any assignment not submitted.
</li>
</ol>
