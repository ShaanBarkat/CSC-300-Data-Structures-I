<h1>CSC 300/Data Structures in Java I<br />Assignment: Play notes from file</h1>
<h2>10 points</h2>
<hr />
<h2>Setting up</h2>
<p>
First, please read the section "Assignments and grading" in the <a href="Syllabus.html">syllabus</a>.  Then, following the steps for <a href="Creating programs.html">creating programs</a>, create a package called <code>playScale</code>.
</p>
<h2>Specifications</h2>
<p>
<p>
You are given a file <a href="scalenotes.txt"><code>scalenotes.txt</code></a> that contains, in order, the floating point frequencies of the notes on a piano.  Place this file into the <code>data</code> folder on Eclipse.
</p>
<p>
Using the program class <code>FileAverage</code> for an example of how to read a sequence of values from a file, write a program class called <code>PlayScale</code> that reads those frequencies into an array and then plays each of them for 1/8 of a second.  Recall that floating point values are held by a variable of type <code>double</code> in Java.
</p>
<h2>Submission instructions</h2>
<p>
When done correctly, you will have a single program <code>PlayScale.java</code> in a package called <code>playScale</code>.  This is located in your file system under the workspace folder you created for Eclipse.  Starting at that folder, navigate to <code>algs4/src/playScale</code>.  Zip that folder (that is, zip the folder <code>playScale</code> NOT just the file <code>PlayScale.java</code>) into a zip file called <code>playScale.zip</code> and submit that zip file into the D2L dropbox for this assignment no later than its due date.
</p>
<p>
Four very important points to remember:
<ol>
<li>
Your name must appear in a comment at the top of the program.  You can insert it either in this style:
<pre>
// Author: Alan Turing
</pre>
or this style:
<pre>
/*
 * Author: Alan Turing
 */
</pre>
<li>
Give the files the names EXACTLY as specified, including the capitalization.  Not doing so will cause points to be deducted.
</li>
<li>
A submission may be graded as soon as it appears in its drop box.  In other words, don't submit until you're sure that you want the program graded.
</li>
<li>
Just after the due date, zero points will automatically be given any assignment not submitted.
</li>
</ol>
