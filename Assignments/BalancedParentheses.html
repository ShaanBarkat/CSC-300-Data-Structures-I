<h1>CSC 300/Data Structures in Java I<br />Assignment: Check balanced parentheses</h1>
<h2>10 points</h2>
<hr />
<h2>Setting up</h2>
<p>
First, please read the section "Assignments and grading" in the <a href="Syllabus.html">syllabus</a>.  Then, following the steps for <a href="Creating programs.html">creating programs</a>, create a package called <code>balancedParentheses</code>.
</p>
<h2>Specifications</h2>
<p>
<p>
Write a program that prompts the user for a string.  Using the pseudocode algorithm below, determine and print whether the parentheses in that string are balanced.
<pre>
Prompt the user for a string
Create an empty stack for characters
For each character in the string
  if the character is '('
    push it onto the stack
  else if the character is ')'
    if the stack is not empty
      pop a character from the stack
    else
      print a message that an unbalanced right parenthesis was found and where it was found
      exit the program
    end
  end // We ignore characters that are not parentheses.
end
If the stack is not empty
  print a message that unbalanced left parentheses were found
else
  print a message that the parentheses are balanced
end
</pre>
To exit a Java program, use the statement <code>System.exit(0);</code>
</p>
<h2>Submission instructions</h2>
<p>
When done correctly, you will have a single program <code>BalancedParentheses.java</code> in a package called <code>balancedParentheses</code>.  This is located in your file system under the workspace folder you created for Eclipse.  Starting at that folder, navigate to <code>algs4/src/balancedParentheses</code>.  Zip that folder (that is, zip the folder <code>balancedParentheses</code> NOT just the file <code>BalancedParentheses.java</code>) into a zip file called <code>balancedParentheses.zip</code> and submit that zip file into the D2L dropbox for this assignment no later than its due date.
</p>
<p>
Four very important points to remember:
<ol>
<li>
Your name must appear in a comment at the top of the program.  You can insert it either in this style:
<pre>
// Author: Alan Turing
</pre>
or this style:
<pre>
/*
 * Author: Alan Turing
 */
</pre>
<li>
Give the files the names EXACTLY as specified, including the capitalization.  Not doing so will cause points to be deducted.
</li>
<li>
A submission may be graded as soon as it appears in its drop box.  In other words, don't submit until you're sure that you want the program graded.
</li>
<li>
Just after the due date, zero points will automatically be given any assignment not submitted.
</li>
</ol>
