<h1>CSC 300/Data Structures in Java I<br />Assignment: Play chords from file</h1>
<h2>15 points</h2>
<hr />
<h2>Setting up</h2>
<p>
First, please read the section "Assignments and grading" in the <a href="Syllabus.html">syllabus</a>.  Then, following the steps for <a href="Creating programs.html">creating programs</a>, create a package called <code>playChords</code>.
</p>
<h2>Specifications</h2>
<p>
<p>
You are given a file <a href="chords.txt"><code>chords.txt</code></a> where each line contains three double values.  The first value is a duration and the second and third values are frequencies.  Place this file into the <code>data</code> folder on Eclipse.
</p>
<p>
Once again you are to read values in from a file but you must be careful in doing this as different values mean different things.  After you open the file, follow this pseudocode:
<pre>
While not at the end of file for StdIn {
  declare an array of length 2
  read the duration
  for i in the range 0 to 1
    read the frequency into the ith frequencies array entry
  end
  play the chord
end
</pre>
Note that we are now using nested loops.
</p>
<p>
To play a chord, you will need a different method and that's included here:
<pre>
	public static void playChord(double duration, double[] frequencies) {
		final int sliceCount = (int) (StdAudio.SAMPLE_RATE * duration);
		final double[] slices = new double[sliceCount+1];
		for (int i = 0; i &lt;= sliceCount; i++) {
			double chord = 0.0;
			for (double frequency: frequencies) {
				chord += Math.sin(2 * Math.PI * i * frequency / StdAudio.SAMPLE_RATE);
			}
			slices[i] = chord/frequencies.length;
		}
		StdAudio.play(slices);
	}
</pre>
</p>
<h2>Submission instructions</h2>
<p>
When done correctly, you will have a single program <code>PlayChords.java</code> in a package called <code>playChords</code>.  This is located in your file system under the workspace folder you created for Eclipse.  Starting at that folder, navigate to <code>algs4/src/playChords</code>.  Zip that folder (that is, zip the folder <code>playChords</code> NOT just the file <code>PlayChords.java</code>) into a zip file called <code>playChords.zip</code> and submit that zip file into the D2L dropbox for this assignment no later than its due date.
</p>
<p>
Four very important points to remember:
<ol>
<li>
Your name must appear in a comment at the top of the program.  You can insert it either in this style:
<pre>
// Author: Alan Turing
</pre>
or this style:
<pre>
/*
 * Author: Alan Turing
 */
</pre>
<li>
Give the files the names EXACTLY as specified, including the capitalization.  Not doing so will cause points to be deducted.
</li>
<li>
A submission may be graded as soon as it appears in its drop box.  In other words, don't submit until you're sure that you want the program graded.
</li>
<li>
Just after the due date, zero points will automatically be given any assignment not submitted.
</li>
</ol>
